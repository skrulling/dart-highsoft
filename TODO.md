# TODO

## Features
- See ongoing games on frontpage, or add page for games
    This is so that it will be easier for people from Bergen and Vik to play in the same game.
- Games: Click each played match to see more stats, like who played, highest round score and so on
- Spec mode: Show some more fun stats about the game, like highest round score
- Spec mode: Show all end of round scores on screen, not just high ones
- Realtime: Fix sync problems
- 1 sec delay before switching to next player
- Score UI is not ideal for two player mode
- Spec mode: larger numbers

### Small fixes

### Bugs
- Some text overflow on mobile when user has long name
